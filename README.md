We pulled data from a variety of sources to see if there are observable impacts of climate change in relation to natural disasters and related costs. 
In particular, we wanted the answers to the following questions: Is temperature rising over time? Is there a relationship between rising temperatures, frequency of natural disasters and the costs of natural disasters? And is there a relationship between rising temperatures and sea level rise?
While we found there are observable relationships between temperature change, the number of natural disasters and sea level rise, none of them were statistically signficant based on limited data points.
