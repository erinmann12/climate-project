# project-one

**Background**

For this group project, we pulled data from a variety of sources to see if there are observable impacts of climate change in relation to natural disasters and related costs. 
In particular, we wanted the answers to the following questions: Is temperature rising over time? Is there a relationship between rising temperatures, frequency of natural disasters and the costs of natural disasters? And is there a relationship between rising temperatures and sea level rise?
While we found there are observable relationships between temperature change, the number of natural disasters and sea level rise, none of them were statistically signficant based on limited data points.

**Tools Used**

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Matplotlib

**Project Tasks**

We stated by pulling all of our data into a Jupyter Notebook to explore the data. My responsibility was to explore the number of disasters experienced in each state and then use groupby to look at the total billion dollar disaster count by year. using that data, I created a line chart to visualize how the number of disasters have increased over time.

Next, I organized the data by state to see the total number of billion dollar disasters by state. Using that data frame, I created a pie chart to visualize the number of disasters in Arizona and Florida to go with the API data uncovered by a teammate.
